Everyone is permitted to copy, distribute, modify, merge, sell, publish,
sublicense, or do whatever the heck you want with this software, subject
to the following conditions:

0. You acknowledge that security tools are like lightsabers - cool, powerful,
   and potentially dangerous in the wrong hands. Don't be that person.

1. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF LITERALLY ANYTHING.
   If it breaks something, sets your server on fire, or causes your coffee
   machine to achieve sentience and unionize, that's on you, buddy.

2. You SHALL NOT use this software for evil. "Evil" includes, but is not
   limited to:
   - Hacking systems without explicit permission
   - Stealing data that isn't yours
   - Being a general jerkface to others
   - Using Comic Sans in your UIs

3. If you find a vulnerability using this tool, you MUST:
   a) Responsibly disclose it to the affected party
   b) High-five yourself (virtually or physically)
   c) Consider buying the original author a coffee/beer/non-alcoholic
      beverage of choice

4. If you make tons of money using this tool, you don't legally have to
   share it with the original author, but karma works in mysterious ways,
   and the universe remembers cheapskates.

5. When crediting this software, you SHALL refer to it as "FATT" or
   "Find All The Things", not as "that security scanner thingy I found
   on GitHub" or "hackerman tool #42".

6. If you're using this for legitimate security testing (which you should be),
   and you get positive results, you MUST say at least once, "I'm in" in your
   best movie-hacker voice. This is non-negotiable.

7. THE BIGGEST CONDITION: Pass on what you have learned. Software security
   is a team sport; the more people who understand it, the safer we all are.

8. Any modified versions of this software must carry prominent notices
   stating that you changed the software and the date of any change. You
   know, so people know who to blame.

                    -- May your false positives be few
                       and your exploits be ethical --
