## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of FATT seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**
2. **Email the project maintainer directly** or create a private security advisory in the GitHub repository
3. **Include details** such as:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes if you have them

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report as soon as possible and will work on addressing it.

## Security Features

FATT is a security tool itself, designed to help identify potential security issues in web applications. As such, we strive to maintain high security standards in our own codebase.

- All dependencies are regularly updated to address known vulnerabilities
- We use Rust's memory safety features to minimize the risk of memory-related security issues
- The codebase undergoes regular security reviews

## Updates and Mitigations

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed and fixed. Users are encouraged to stay updated with the latest version of FATT.
